WARNING CURRENTLY NOT WORKING

Youtube Comment Searcher

The title is pretty self explanatory, it's a Ruby on Rails app designed to import massive amounts of comments from a given youtube video.
The main purpose would be so that you can search can quickly do mass searches for testominals for your business/product/or whatever else you need.
The app is currently exteremly cumbersome to setup and work with due to Youtube's limited API quota, but I'm working on batching pulls of comments.

Requirments:

  * Ruby 3.0.1
  * Rails 6+
  * Postgresql 9+ 
  * Nginx (not tested, but probably easy to use Apache as well)
  * PhusionPassenger
  * Linux Server

Instructions on setup:

  Coming Soon
