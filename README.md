WARNING CURRENTLY NOT WORKING

Youtube Comment Searcher

THe title is pretty self explanatory, it's a Ruby on Rails site designed to import massive amounts of comments from a given youtube video.
The main purpose would be so that you can search can quickly do mass searches testominals for your business/product/or whatever else you need.
The app is currently exteremly cumbersome to setup and work with due to Youtube's limited and slow API, but I'm working on speeding it up.

Requirments:

  * Ruby 3.0.1
  * Rails 6+
  * Postgresql 9+ (You will need your own database depending on how many comments you're working with)
  * Nginx (not tested, but probably easy to use Apache as well)
  * PhusionPassenger
  * Linux Server

Instructions on setup:

  Coming Soon
